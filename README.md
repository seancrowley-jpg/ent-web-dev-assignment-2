The Application is for creating and viewing Walks/Cycle paths around Ireland. Users can signup and add Walks with a name, description, location, images and a category.

Users can view other users walks and sort walks by their preferred category wether they are looking for long/short walks or cycle paths or even mountain paths. When viewing a walk
users can see the current weather at the location and view the images submitted. Users can also delete and update their own Walks.
